Botpress includes its own **Content Management System** (or **CMS**) to manage a chatbot's content. Everything your chatbot says comes from the CMS. Before we start discussing how you can create and edit the content of your chatbot, we should understand the different concepts of the CMS in Botpress.

## Content Type

A **Content Types** defines the structure of what the chatbot sends. It also describes how your chatbot should render the content. It can be as straightforward or as complex as you want. For instance, a Content-Type could be a simple text or an image, or a carousel. They can describe anything and everything â€“ they most often are domain-specific to your chatbot.

> **ðŸŒŸ Tip**: As a general rule, the more domain-specific the Content Types are, the easier it is to manage the chatbot for non-technical people.

Content Types are particular to the chatbots with which they are associated. Here are some typical examples:

- A restaurant "Menu" and "MenuPage" types
- A "QuestionWithChoices" type
- An "ImportantBroadcast" type

As you can see, Content Types on Botpress are much more specific than generalized "message types" on traditional chatbot building platforms.

Developers define content Types in JavaScript. Each Content Type has its own `.js` file, and Botpress automatically finds and registers new Content Types based on the directory and naming convention of the file.

## Content Element

A **Content Element** contains the data of a Content-Type. Multiple Elements can belong to a single Content-Type. For instance, the "text" Content-Type will include an Element for every sentence of your Bot, e.g., "Hello!", "What is your name?" etc.

Here's a Content Element example:

```json
{
  "id": "builtin_text-pSsHWg",
  "formData": {
    "text": "ðŸ‘‹, {{state.$r}}!",
    "variations": ["Hello, {{state.$r}}!", "Welcome to Botpress, {{state.$r}}!"],
    "typing": true
  },
  "createdBy": "admin",
  "createdOn": "2018-05-14T00:57:36.026Z"
}
```

All Content Elements of the same Content Type are stored within a single `.json` file under the `data/bots/{your-bot}/content-elements/` directory.

> **Tip**: Remember that a Content Type tells **how** content gets rendered and a Content Element tells **what** to render.

## Channel Specific Rendering

All Content Types define a `renderElement` function that tells how a Content Element gets rendered on different channels.

> **Note:** This is critical because every channel is different and has a different set of functionalities. You want to customize and leverage the features of the different platforms to offer the best user experience as possible.

### Example

Here's the web rendering function of the Text Content Type:

```javascript
function renderForWeb(data) {
  const events = []

  if (data.typing) {
    events.push({
      type: 'typing',
      value: data.typing
    })
  }

  return [
    ...events,
    {
      type: 'text',
      markdown: true,
      text: data.text
    }
  ]
}
```

Now if we'd like to render for the messenger channel, we would add a specific rendering function for messenger and call it when `channel === 'messenger'`

```javascript
function renderForMessenger(data) {
  const events = []

  return [
    ...events,
    {
      type: 'message',
      user: data.profile,
      text: data.text,
      raw: data
    }
  ]
}

function renderElement(data, channel) {
  if (channel === 'web') {
    return renderForWeb(data)
  } else if (channel === 'messenger') {
    return renderForMessenger(data) // We add our rendering function
  }

  return []
}
```

## Translation

Your chatbots can support multiple languages. If a specific translation is not available for the current language, the chatbot will use the default language. When a user chats with your chatbot, we extract the browser's language and save it as a user attribute (available on the event as `user.language`).

Once that property is set, it will never be overwritten. Therefore, you can ask the user what his preferred language is or use the NLU engine to detect it.

When rendering content elements, we will try to render the user's configured language; otherwise, it will use the chatbot's default one.
